### now you're ready to start looking for patterns!
  
### let's do some exploratory plots first

dframe1Sum <- dframe1[dframe1$Season=="Summer",]
dframe1Spr <- dframe1[dframe1$Season=="Spring",]
dframe1Win <- dframe1[dframe1$Season=="Winter",]
dframe1Aut <- dframe1[dframe1$Season=="Autumn",]

plot(PollenLoad ~ Treatment, dframe1Sum, outline=F)
plot(PollenLoad ~ Treatment, dframe1Spr, outline=F)
plot(PollenLoad ~ Treatment, dframe1Win, outline=F)
plot(PollenLoad ~ Treatment, dframe1Aut, outline=F)

plot(PollenTypes ~ Treatment, dframe1Sum)
plot(PollenTypes ~ Treatment, dframe1Spr)
plot(PollenTypes ~ Treatment, dframe1Win)
plot(PollenTypes ~ Treatment, dframe1Aut)

plot(PollenYN ~ Treatment, dframe1Sum)
plot(PollenYN ~ Treatment, dframe1Spr)
plot(PollenYN ~ Treatment, dframe1Win)
plot(PollenYN ~ Treatment, dframe1Aut)


### Let's first look at pollen load per-moth
### Plot it against treatment so you have an idea of what to expect
plot(PollenLoad ~ Treatment, data = dframe1, outline=F)
plot(PollenLoad ~ Season, data = dframe1, outline=FALSE)
plot(PollenLoad ~ Month, data = dframe1, outline=FALSE)
hist(dframe1$PollenLoad)
hist(log(dframe1$PollenLoad+1,10))

### Data clearly have lots of skew, so it's worth checking for overdispersion
### Simplest test is to compare the mean and variance. 
### In a regular Poisson distribution, mean ~= variance; if variance is much larger, data are overdispersed
mean(dframe1$PollenLoad)
var(dframe1$PollenLoad)

### Data appear overdispersed, so we will try two types of model in addition to Poisson: quasi-Poisson, and negative binomial
### Zero-inflated models might be appropriate to try as well

# construct models using Date and Site as random effects
# random effects are factors that might affect the output variable, but not in a way that is interesting to us
# you might see variation between different sampling days, or between different fire or non-fire sites...
# ...but we are only really interested in variation due to Treatment


# Poisson model using lme4

model1P <- glmer(PollenLoad ~ Treatment*Season # fixed effects
                 +(1|Year) + (1|Site) + (1|Date), # random effects

# the best test of a GLMM is a Likelihood Ratio Test, which compares the fit of the model to if each term was removed one at a time using Chi-squared tests
# to run an LRT, use the drop1 function (i.e. drop 1 term at a time), specifying Chi-squared
drop1(model1P, test="Chisq")  



# check the model's residuals
# this custom function produces a selection of plots that you can scroll through to check that residuals look ok
# you want residuals that are roughly normally distributed around zero with no obvious trends
chkres(model1P, dframe1$Treatment, dframe1$Season)  # these residuals do appear to have a negative trend so they are not ideal; this might be driven by zeroes


# QuasiPoisson model using MASS

model1Q <- glmmPQL(PollenLoad ~ Treatment*Season,
                   random = list(~1|Year, ~1|Site, ~1|Date),

#summary(model1ZIP)

#Anova(model1ZIP, type="III")
#drop1(model1ZIP, test="Chisq")

# chkres.zi(model1ZIP, dframe1$Treatment, dframe1$Season) # these aren't great either

# negative binomial

model1NB <- glmer.nb(PollenLoad ~ Treatment*Season # fixed effects
                     + (1|Year) + (1|Site) + (1|Date), # random effects
                     data = dframe1)

chkconv(model1NB)

summary(model1NB)
drop1(model1NB, test= "Chisq") # glmer.nb produces the same model class as glmer so we can treat it the same

chkres(model1NB, dframe1$Treatment, dframe1$Season) # these are still worse than just the Poisson

# Gaussian with log transformation

model1G <- lmer(log(PollenLoad+1,10) ~ Treatment*Season
                + (1|Year) + (1|Site) + (1|Date),

summary(model1G)
drop1(model1G, test = "Chi")

chkres(model1G, dframe1$Treatment, dframe1$Season)   # these are still affected by the zeroes but are probably the most balanced yet

### choose from these candidate error families
### we can see from the residuals that model1G is the best option so we use this result

summary(model1G)
drop1(model1G, test = "Chi")



### Let's now look at pollen types per-moth
### Plot it against treatment so you have an idea of what to expect
plot(PollenTypes ~ Treatment, data = dframe1)
plot(PollenTypes ~ Season, data = dframe1)
hist(dframe1$PollenTypes)
hist(log(dframe1$PollenTypes+1,10))

### Again data clearly have lots of skew, though not so bad, so it's worth checking for overdispersion
### Simplest test is to compare the mean and variance. 
### In a regular Poisson distribution, mean ~= variance; if variance is much larger, data are overdispersed
mean(dframe1$PollenTypes)
var(dframe1$PollenTypes)

### Data appear possibly overdispersed, so we will try two types of model in addition to Poisson: quasi-Poisson, and negative binomial

# construct models using Date and Site as random effects


# Poisson model using lme4

model2P <- glmer(PollenTypes ~ Treatment * Season # fixed effects

drop1(model2P, test="Chisq")  



# check the model's residuals
chkres(model2P, dframe1$Treatment, dframe1$Season)  # these residuals do appear to have a slight positive trend but probably nothing to worry about too much


# QuasiPoisson model using MASS

chkres.PQL(model2Q, dframe1$Treatment, dframe1$Season) # these look better in some ways, worse in others - slight negative trend


# Negative binomial model using lme4

model2NB <- glmer.nb(PollenTypes ~ Treatment * Season # fixed effects
                     + (1|Year) + (1|Site) + (1|Date), # random effects

summary(model2NB)

### choose from these candidate error families
### the residuals are all reasonable but have minor faults. The only ones without obvious trends are model2G





### finally, let's look at proportion of moths carrying pollen

### Plot it against treatment so you have an idea of what to expect
plot(PollenYN ~ Treatment, data = dframe1)
plot(PollenYN ~ Season, data = dframe1)
hist(dframe1$PollenYN)

### this data is definitely binomial, so we don't need to worry too much about model selection or residuals:

model3B <- glmer(PollenYN~Treatment*Season
                 + (1|Year) + (1|Site) + (1|Date),
                 family = binomial (link = "logit"),
                 data = dframe1)
