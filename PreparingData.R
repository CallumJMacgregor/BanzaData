### Clear the workspace
rm(list=ls())


### install if necessary and then load the libraries you need

j <- c("reshape2","plyr")

new.packages <- j[!(j %in% installed.packages()[,"Package"])]
if(length(new.packages)) install.packages(new.packages)


lapply(j, require, character.only = TRUE)  # loads up any libraries that aren't already loaded


### read in the data - this is the raw data as input by Paula. 
# I have manually added a column called 'sampleID' with a unique number for each row of the dataframe;
# I have renamed "Family/Species" to "Family_Species", 
# and added _1 to the first PollenType and PollenNumber column for consistency
dframe1<-read.csv("Data/BanzaDataNoct.csv", header=TRUE)

summary(dframe1) # Check it's imported correctly

### Remove redundant PollenTypes 14 & 15
dframe1 <- dframe1[,1:32]

### Melt the dataframe
names(dframe1) # check what columns you have and what they're called

# create a dframe with all the family/species names for each sample

                      id=c("SampleID","Family_Species","Date","Site","SlideNumber","PollenCount"))

#label each row of the new dframe and remove the old column headings
melt1$level.order <- seq(1, length(melt1$SampleID),1)

# label each row of the new dframe and remove the old column headings
melt2$level.order <- seq(1, length(melt2$SampleID),1)
melt2 <- melt2[,c(1:6,8:9)]  #trim out the ID column - this is important for merging back together

# rename the 'value' column on the second dframe so it merges correctly
colnames(melt2) <- c("SampleID","Family_Species","Date","Site","SlideNumber","PollenCount", "value2","level.order")

# merge the dframes back together

# reformat the data into a matrix
matrix1 <- dcast(dframe1.melt, SampleID + Family_Species + Date +
                   Site + SlideNumber + PollenCount ~ PollenType,
                 value.var = "PollenNumber",

# this has added an extra column (I don't know why!) but let's delete it
matrix1 <- matrix1[,c(1:6,8:80)]

# output the reformatted dataframe to a .txt file to use in downstream analysis
write.table(matrix1, "Data\\MatrixNoct.txt", sep="\t", row.names=FALSE)

# N.B. at this point any typing errors in species names will become obvious as they will be assigned an additional column.
# Therefore at this point, go back to the raw data, find these typing errors, correct them, and run this script again.



# now we want to produce a separate file with the data organised by each sampling session at each site
# we will do this by aggregating samples from the same site and sampling session

matrix1r <- matrix1[,c(3:4,7:79)]

# output the reformatted dataframe to a .txt file to use in downstream analysis
